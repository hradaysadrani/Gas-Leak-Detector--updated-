# SMS-Based Gas Leak Accident Prevention System
 The idea about this topic was conceptualized when news about LPG gas leak accidents where on rise. According to 
the data given by Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas of India, from year 2017 to 2022, 5,122 incidents of 
accidents involving LPG have been reported which resulted to expenditure of Rs.67.62 crores as insurance policy 
claims to public sector marketing companies (OMCs) (IOCL, HPCL, etc.). It also led to loss of lives and private property 
whose worth was in multiple crores.

To prevent such accidents, a prototype of this project was made in the year 2018 which had an SMS alert mechanism 
on occasion of gas leak and control of gas regulator with the help of a customized Blynk mobile application. Later, 
further improvement was done in it so that it can be pracƟcally used by public / industries in real world. To make this 
possible, a group of three enthusiasƟc people came forward started working on enhancing the features of this 
project. 

The SMS-based Gas Leak Prevention System is designed to enhance safety by preventing accidents caused by gas 
leaks. Leveraging the ESP32 microcontroller and the A9G GSM+GPS module, this system offers automatic valve 
control, and timely alerts to user in case of gas leak. The following system is envisaged to have following features -: 

1) Gas Leak Detection: The system continuously monitors gas levels (LPG primarily Butane and Propane) using 
MQ – 2 / MQ – 6 gas sensors. When a leak is detected, it triggers an immediate response.
 
2) Valve Control: In case of a gas leak, the system automatically closes the gas valve or regulator to prevent 
further leakage.

3) User Alerts: The system sends alerts to the user via SMS or notifications on their mobile device, ensuring 
prompt action. 

4) Industrial Application: For industrial units, the system provides the GPS location of the gas leak site. This 
information can be sent to the owner or manager for quick response and mitigation. 

5) Low power consumption: The system operates on only 5V supply with need of less than 0.5A of current. 
Making it suitable to operate on batteries for longer duration in case of power cut. 

This system has the potential to save many lives and prevent property damage of huge worth, making it a valuable 
addition to both domestic and industrial environments. Also, many customizations are possible which will increase 
the efficiency and usability of system, reduce its manufacturing cost, and ultimately become a more economical 
option as an accident prevention system. Suggestions / Feedbacks regarding this project is most welcome!
