# SMS-Based Gas Leak Accident Prevention System

 -> **Video explaination of this project** ▶️ ->   https://youtu.be/zow6AbGhIyU 
 
 The idea about this topic was conceptualized when news about LPG gas leak accidents where on rise. According to 
the data given by Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas of India, from year 2017 to 2022, 5,122 incidents of 
accidents involving LPG have been reported which resulted to expenditure of Rs.67.62 crores as insurance policy 
claims to public sector marketing companies (OMCs) (IOCL, HPCL, etc.). It also led to loss of lives and private property 
whose worth was in multiple crores.

**Did you know?** 🤔🤔

1) In Bengaluru, there was a 21.6% rise in cases of fire accidents caused by leaking LPG cylinders between the years 2022 and 2023.📈📈
   
2) Over half of the flame burn injuries reported in a Central Delhi hospital were due to household LPG leaks (according to a study conducted between 2016 and 2020 by doctors from Ram Manohar Lohia hospital).

We oftenly hear such news of LPG gas leak accidents in the headlines of TV news channels. 

So, to prevent such accidents, with the help of ESP32 microcontroller, I have designed an "SMS-Based Gas leak accident prevention system" which alerts user about the leak and automatically turns off regulator/ valve to prevent accident.

***Salient Features of the System*** 💡💡 -: 

1) Automatic closing of valve/ regulator in case of a gas leak and simultaneously alerting the user about the action taken by the system.🤝🤝

2) Low power consumption.🌱🌱
-> Operates on 5v with need of less than 0.5A current. Hence, it can easily be powered through solar energy as well.

3) Easy customization and upgradability.✔️✔️
-> As ESP32 also has a Wi-Fi chip onboard, the project can further be easily upgraded to add functionalities like alert through E-mail or mobile app notification, knowing the current status of system as well as Lights and exhaust fan through an mobile app, and many more..

4) Potential to be optimized more and make the device cost-effective.🚅🚅
-> The system's accuracy currently stands at around 90% which can be further optimized through various methods and cost can also be lowered by choosing selective components and manufacturing it on a large scale.

5) And much more..

In this repository, you will get code and circuit diagram of this project.
